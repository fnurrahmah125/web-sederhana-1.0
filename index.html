            <h2>Bandung</h2>
            <p class="source">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
            <p>Bandung (/ˈbɑːndʊŋ/) is the capital of West Java province in Indonesia. Based on the official mid-2020
                estimate, it is Indonesia's fourth most populous city after Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bekasi with 2,510,103
                inhabitants.[4] Greater Bandung is the country's third-largest metropolitan area with over 8.5 million
                inhabitants.[5] Located 768 metres (2,520 feet) above sea level, approximately 140 kilometres (87 miles)
                southeast of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other Indonesian cities. The
                city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provides a natural defence system,
                which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the capital from
                Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.</p>
            <p>The Dutch first established tea plantations around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was
                constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital Batavia (180 kilometres (112 miles)
                to the northwest). In the early 20th century the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment
                of a municipality (gemeente), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort
                city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, cafés, and European boutiques were opened,
                leading the city to be nicknamed Parijs van Java (Dutch: "The Paris of Java").</p>
            <p>After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, the city has experienced ongoing development and
                urbanisation, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km2 (per square kilometre)
                metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people. New skyscrapers, high-rise buildings,
                bridges, and gardens have been constructed. Natural resources have been heavily exploited, particularly
                by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Although the city has
                encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods, to a complicated traffic system
                resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend
                sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. In 2017 the city won a regional environmental
                sustainability award for having the cleanest air among major cities in ASEAN.[6] The city is also known
                as a Smart City, leveraging technology to improve government services and social media, that alert
                residents to issues such as floods or traffic jams. Bandung is Indonesia's major technology
                center.[7][8]
            </p>
            <p>The first Asian-African Conference, the Bandung Conference, was hosted in Bandung by President Sukarno in
                1955. Redevelopment of the existing Bandung international airport (BDO) was completed in 2016. To
                improve infrastructure, the construction of a Jakarta-Bandung High-speed rail was started in 2016, with
                projected completion in 2021. This is to be complemented by an indigenous type of Automated People Mover
                (APM) and Light Rail Transit (LRT).[9][10] The new larger second airport, Bandung Kertajati
                International Airport opened in June 2018, just in time for the Asian Games 2018.</p>
